    'Please note that you will not be able to assign signatories for the eSign document when you create it here. However, the system will automatically route the eSign document to the appropriate user with the designated role of contract signatory in each company when the launch pack/renewal pack action items are initiated by the advisor. If the contract signatory is not defined, then the eSign documents will go to the account owner in each company. Once the document is sent for eSign, the sender or the receiver wonâ€™t be able to change signatories. If signatories need to be changed, you can send a new document for eSign.';
